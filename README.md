# opencv_head_detection

It's I and my friend's simple project.
We use `opencv_createsamples.exe` to create samples and `opencv_traincascade.exe` to train.
Dataset is included.

## Usage
1.Run
`createsamples.bat`
to create cropped images(in the directory /NegCropped and /PosCropped).
2.Run
`train.bat`
to create XML file of classifiers(named **cascade.xml**).
